OrderNow - A multi-tenant order service application
========

An Online Order Service(SaaS)  - Restaurants/Small businesses can host their catalog/menu in less than one hour and start taking orders online. This is targeted for very small businesses. Businesses can receive orders through fax or computers or phone. This service has SSL, Credit Card payments, Order tracking and cancellations. Restaurants can upload new images and change the skin of this. 

This was developed in 2008 and hosted by two restaurants and a grocery store. Backend is still solid and very valid. UI is a disaster and re-work is needed.
